<h3>Qualitative test result</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Worry:</strong>
  Worry refers to financial anxiety. High scorers experience more financial stress when
  thinking about their finances. It usually helps to take a long-term view and reduce the frequency
  of evaluation of your assets (such as stocks) for changes in value. They see the dark cloud in every
  silver lining and are obsessed with risk management. Taking a passive approach to their investments
  is usually an effective coping strategy. Low scorers on the other hand may be financially reckless
  and may exhibit risk-seeking behaviour.<br />

  <strong>Motivation:</strong>
  Motivation refers to the level of interest in learning about investments, keeping track
  of economic trends, and managing money. High scorers are likely to have some enthusiasm for managing
  their own finances. They are also more likely to be self-starters who will perform requested research
  and take an active interest in managing their money. Low scorers typically require some education.
  Low scorers will lose interest in managing their finances if it is perceived as dull or tedious.<br />

<p>
  <strong>Self Interest:</strong>
  Self-interested people will be more financially independent. High scorers are more
  likely to be autonomous decision makers, even to the point of distrusting outside financial advisorsâ€™
  intentions. Additionally, they abhor whatever may feasibly be construed as wastage such as high fees
  for a service or even charitable giving. Low scorers are more financially open and accommodative
  towards others. Low scorers may also be more trusting and generous, which makes them ideal targets
  for inappropriate requests for money from relatives and friends. They may also entertain feelings of
  guilt over their wealth and may be somewhat indecisive when considering financial plans.<br />

<p>
  <strong>Discipline:</strong>
  Discipline refers to the ability to organise your finances and prepare for financial
  contingencies. Discipline is necessary in order to follow a financial plan. High scorers are more
  likely to stay consistent with a plan. Low scorers may not have prioritised financial planning in
  the past. Low scorers will be helped if they can learn to closely associate their emotions with their
  planning. For example, they could train themselves to experience guilt when they make an impulsive
  purchase that jeopardises their budget. Also by learning how to see opportunity in the organisation
  of their finances, and working to better manage emotional blocks, their financial planning will become
  more effortless and even fun.<br />

<p>
  <strong>Thrill Seeking:</strong>
  Thrill seeking as the name implies refers to people who seek excitement even in
  their investing and financial planning. Financial thrill seeking is not necessarily always bad as
  it can motivate people to unearth opportunities. Thrill seeking can be a problem when it leads to
  imprudence and excessive risk taking. High scorers are more inclined to pick volatile stocks, neglect
  savings, attach undue importance to tips, exhibit a marked preference for high-risk/high-reward
  strategies and have unsustainably high expectations. Low scorers are likely to be more sober and
  deliberate decision makers.<br />
